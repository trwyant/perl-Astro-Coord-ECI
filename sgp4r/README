This directory contains the works for generating the sgp4r Perl code
from the "Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3" code. The contents of this
directory are as follows:

FOR - the Fortran code from Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3. The .exe
    file is deleted, but the rest is in CVS so that we can track
    changes. The original is available in
    http://celestrak.org/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/AIAA-2006-6753.zip
    as is sgp4-ver.tle, which is used to test.

Makefile - Make various things:
    sgp4unit.pl (the default target) - converts sgp4unit.for to Perl,
	using the for2pl script and the sgp4unit.spec conversion
	specification. This file is pasted verbatim into TLE.pm.
    testfor - compiles the Fortran in the FOR directory using g77.
    test - runs testfor, and feeds it the canonical input (run type 'V',
	constants '72', input file 'sgp4-ver.tle).
    clean - deletes files generated by the test.
    realclean - deletes testfor and sgp4unit.pl, plus anything deleted
	by the 'clean' target.

README - this file.

for2pl - A semi-general-purpose script to convert Fortran 77 to Perl. A
    conversion specification file can be given to control the conversion
    of variables to (e.g.) Perl hash references, modify formal and
    actual parameter lists, add initialization and termination code, and
    maybe other things.

sgp4unit.spec - The specification file used by for2pl to control the
    conversion of sgp4unit.for to sgp4unit.pl.

sgp4-ver.tle - The TLE data for the Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3 test
    suite, converted to UNIX line endings for the benefit of the Fortran
    code. The original (with DOS line endings) comes from the same zip
    file as the Fortran code itself.

All the above are in CVS unless otherwise noted.
