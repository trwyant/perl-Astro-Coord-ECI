Astro-satpass

This package contains classes needed to predict satellite visibility,
and a demonstration application (satpass) that makes use of these
classes. The classes themselves are:

Astro::Coord::ECI - superclass (coordinate transforms)
Astro::Coord::ECI::Moon - Predict location of the Moon.
Astro::Coord::ECI::Star - Predict location of a star.
Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun - Predict location of the Sun.
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE - Predict location of a satellite.
Astro::Coord::ECI::Utils - Constants and utility subroutines.

This package is installable by the usual incantation:

    gunzip Astro-satpass-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Astro-satpass-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
the .pm files into the Astro/Coord/ECI directory (creating it if
necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
